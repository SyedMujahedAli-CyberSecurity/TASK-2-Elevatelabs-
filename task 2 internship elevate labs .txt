Phishing Email Analysis Report — Citibank Suspicious Activity Scam
1. Email Sample :    


2. Examination of Sender’s Email Address (Spoofing)
* Displayed sender: Bank Support@Citibanksecuremygateway.com

* Suspicious points:

   * The domain Citibanksecuremygateway.com is not an official Citibank domain.

   * Legitimate Citibank emails come from addresses ending in @citi.com or @citibank.com.

   * The attacker uses a lookalike domain to trick the recipient.


3. Email Header Analysis using MX toolBox


Discrepancies found:


Message ID: <020202a9871bc2df-bb23d5c7-9a88-4df4-b2a1-e9f3b7123456@citibanksecuremygateway.com>
Created at: Fri, Aug 9, 2025 at 10:42 AM (Delivered after 3 seconds)
From: Bank <Support@Citibanksecuremygateway.com>
To: victim@example.com
Subject: Suspicious Activity
SPF: FAIL with IP 185.213.209.66 Learn more
DKIM: 'FAIL' with domain citibanksecuremygateway.com Learn more
DMARC: 'FAIL' Learn more




 4. Suspicious Links or Attachments
      * Link displayed: https://secure.citibank-verification.com

      * This is a spoofed domain — real Citibank links use citi.com.

      * “verification.com” is unrelated and likely hosts a fake login page.

      * No attachment in this case, but the link is malicious.


5. Urgent or Threatening Language
         * Subject: Suspicious Activity — creates fear.

         * Body: “We’ve identified suspicious activity on your account…” — this pushes urgency to act immediately.

6. Mismatched URLs
            * Visible URL: citibank-verification.com (fake domain).

            * Real Citibank secure login: https://online.citi.com/.

            * Hovering over the link would confirm mismatch.


7. Spelling or Grammar Errors
               * The email is short and clean but overly simplistic for a bank’s security message.

               * Professional banking emails usually contain legal disclaimers, contact numbers, and a customer name.


8. Summary of Phishing Traits
                  * Spoofed sender address using a fake Citibank domain.

                  * Urgent, fear-based subject line.

                  * Suspicious, mismatched URL.

                  * Minimal content with no personalization.

                  * Missing official branding elements like legal disclaimers.
